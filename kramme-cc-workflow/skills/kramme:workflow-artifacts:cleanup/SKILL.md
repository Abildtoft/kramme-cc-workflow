# Clean Up Artifacts

Delete workflow artifacts from the current working directory and generated diagram files under `~/.kramme-cc-workflow/diagrams/`.

**Note:** For SIW-specific cleanup, consider using `/kramme:siw:remove` instead.

## Target Files

Delete the following files if they exist:

**Visual diagram artifacts:**
- `~/.kramme-cc-workflow/diagrams/*.html` (generated by `/kramme:visual:*` skills)

**Review artifacts:**
- `REVIEW_OVERVIEW.md`
- `UX_REVIEW_OVERVIEW.md`
- `AUDIT_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`
- `AUDIT_SPEC_REPORT.md`
- `siw/AUDIT_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`
- `siw/AUDIT_SPEC_REPORT.md`

**Structured Implementation Workflow (SIW) artifacts (in `siw/`):**
- `siw/LOG.md`
- `siw/OPEN_ISSUES_OVERVIEW.md`
- `siw/issues/` directory (only if SIW marker files are present)

**Specification files (in `siw/`):**
- `siw/FEATURE_SPECIFICATION.md`
- `siw/PROJECT_PLAN.md`
- `siw/API_DESIGN.md`
- `siw/DOCUMENTATION_SPEC.md`
- `siw/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`
- `siw/TUTORIAL_PLAN.md`

## Workflow

1. Check which target files exist in the working directory and in `~/.kramme-cc-workflow/diagrams/`
2. If visual diagram artifacts exist in `~/.kramme-cc-workflow/diagrams/`, ask before deleting because this directory is shared across sessions and projects
3. If `siw/issues/` exists:
   - Only delete it if `siw/OPEN_ISSUES_OVERVIEW.md` exists
   - If `siw/issues/` contains non-`ISSUE-*.md` files, ask before deleting or skip and report
4. Delete each remaining file that exists using `trash` (files can be restored from system Trash if needed)
5. Report results:
   - List files that were deleted
   - Note if no artifact files were found
